# Handmade Shopper Bag

The Handmade Shopper Bag site intends to provide instructions to crafters on how to make a simple shopper bag.  The site will be targeted towards beginner crafters and those who want specific information on how some techniques are applied.  Detailed instructions will be provided along with a number of images showing the techniques involved.

## UX Design

Two user personas were identified while researching this project.  The beginner crafter and a more experienced crafter visiting to find information about specific techniques.  These personas were used to develop the user stories shown below.

### User Stories

As a beginner crafter:

- I want to find out how to construct a simple shopper bag.

- I want to find the information on multiple devices as I will return to the website a number of times as I progress through my project.

- I want easy access to the terminology used for sewing and bag making on this website.

- I want to be able to make contact in case I have questions or would like to share my creation.

As an experienced crafter:

- I want to quickly find how a specific bag making technique is completed on the website.

- I want the description and the visuals to explain fully how each technique is completed.

As the site owner:

- I want to develop and share bag making instructions online.

- I would like to create instructional bag making videos for sharing with the crafting community.

### UX Strategy

The user stories helped to define the opportunities for the site.  An assessment of the opportunities helped finalise the strategic objectives around the user experience. Opportunities for both the users and the site owner were rated in terms of importance and viability or feasibility.

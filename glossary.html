                    <dt>fusable</dt>
                    <dd>Another word for 'bond'. Often involves using an iron and a substance which is 'fusible' (and
                        heat activated) such as fusible interfacing or fusible web. Fusible web is a fine mesh adhesive used
                        for bonding layers of fabric together.</dd>
                    
                        
                    <dt>french seam</dt>
                    <dd>With wrong sides together stitch your seam, turn wrong sides out (i.e. right sides together), press
                        (optional) and restitch the seam,
                        using a slightly larger seam allowance. This results in a neat seam with no raw edges to finish.

                    <dt>interfacing</dt>
                    <dd>Interfacing is a fabric which is used to make certain parts of a garment more stable. It is used as an additional layer which is applied to the inside of 
                        garments, such as collars, cuffs, waistbands and pockets, helping to add firmness, shape, structure, and support to the clothes. 
                        There are so many different types of interfacing fabrics to choose from, it can be quite overwhelming. In general, interfacing comes in two main types, 
                        fusible or sew-in, as well as three main weaves (non-woven, woven and knit), and different weights. When designing your piece, it is important to make 
                        the right choice, as this decision can really influence the final look of your garment. 
                        With a heat activated adhesive on one side, this type of interfacing is the easiest to use as it only needs to be heated up with the iron and it will 
                        permanently stick to the fabric. If you are just starting out in dressmaking this fabric is going to be a lot easier and more convenient to use. 
                        It works well on most garments, except on certain fabrics that don't like heat or are woven loosely, as this can cause the glue to seep through.

                    <dt>on the fold</dt>
                    <dd>Usually when cutting out garments, the cutting layout requires that the fabric is folded. This means pieces which are the mirror image of each other 
                        can be cut out in one go. Sometimes though a symmetrical pattern piece will be cut on the fold. The straight side of the pattern piece is aligned 
                        with the fabric fold and the piece is cut without cutting along the folded edge so that when the fabric is opened up the piece is perfectly symmetrical. 
                        Look at the pattern layout and the markings on the pattern piece carefully to work this out.

                    <dt>right sides out</dt>
                    <dd>RSO, or Right Sides Out is usually an instruction to turn something that you’ve sewn together with the right sides facing, 
                        so that it’s the correct way out and the seams are hidden on the inside.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>right sides together</dt>
                    <dd>RST, or Right Sides Together is an instruction to place two named pieces such that the ‘right sides’, ie the sides with the pattern/texture on, 
                        are facing each other. The only fabrics where this doesn’t matter would be solid, linen or dyed fabrics where both sides are the same, 
                        but generally in bag making there will be some form of interfacing or interlining which will effectively create the ‘wrong side’.

                    <dt>seam allowance</dt>
                    <dd>Seam allowance = this is the width from the edge of the fabric to which you will sew. So if a pattern states that you sew 
                        with a 1cm seam allowance, you sew 1cm in from the edge of the fabric.  On all patterns you need to check to see if the seam allowance has 
                        been added to the pattern shapes.
                    </dd>

                    <span class="alpha-headline">W</span>
                    <hr class="alpha-line">   
                    <dt>wrong sides out</dt>
                    <dd>WSO, or wrong sides out can refer to leaving something the way it has been sewn, RST, before carrying out the next step. In bag making you’ll most 
                        often find this in reference to bags where the lining is left WSO and the outer fabric turned RSO, then the outer placed inside the lining to stitch a 
                        final seam. The most common example for this would be a simple rectangular tote bag where you would sew the side and bottom seams, leaving a turning 
                        gap in one of the lining seams, then, having turned the outer RSO, popped it inside the lining, which is still WSO, and sewing around the top 
                        seam before turning the whole thing RSO through the turning gap.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>wrong sides together</dt>
                    <dd>WST, or wrong sides together is the opposite of RST. It’s a rather less common term, but is used most commonly to create French seams where 
                        items are sewn WST then turned and the seam allowance from the first seam is caught inside a second seam. This ensures that there are no raw 
                        edges on the inside of something that you may not want to line.
